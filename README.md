A github recipe repository for food. Fork your own GitFork and collect other recipes from other people.

## Background
Gitfork is concept of recipe documentation that uses GitHub as a repository for sharing said recipes with others. It encourages discussion and feedback to tweak recipes that many other platforms do not offer.

This is more of a fun project to share with friends and family more than anything else. Learning markup, metadata, formatting and most of all sharing the passion of food.
