### Foreword
This recipe requires usage of a Smoker and an Oven to cook the ribs. It utilises the 3-2-1 method of smoking, re-hydrating and final glazing to get the ribs to a tender but not fall-off-the-bone finish.
The Smoking portion of this recipe does require you to understand how your smoker functions and maintains heat as all smokers are not the same in terms of heat source and maintaining temperature. I would highly recommend using a thermometer and an automated BBQ temperature controller.

## Ingredients & Tools
### Tools & Utensils Required
  * Smoker (I used a Weber Kettle 47cm)
  * BBQ Fuel (Charcoal Briquettes)
  * BBQ Thermometer
  * Woodchips (Apple & Hickory)
  * Aluminium Foil
  * Meat Syringe
  * Oven Tray
  * Convection Oven
  * Basting Brush
  
### Pre-mix Ingredients
  * 1 cup of Texas Style Dry Rub
  * 1 Kg of Pork Ribs (Should be 1-2 racks, Cut in Half length-wise)

### Cook Ingredients
  * 1/2 cup of Beef Stock
  * Optional: Bourbon
  * Brown Sugar
  * Baste Sauce: `Lillie's Q Carolina Barbeque Sauce`
  * Primary Glaze: `Sweet Baby Rays BBQ Sauce`
  
## Preparation Method (Min 1 Day before Cooking)

  1. Prepare Dry Rub Mixture or use Pre-Mix Dry Rub
  1. Rub Dry Rub mixture into Pork Ribs covering both meat side and bone side evenly
  1. Place Ribs into container and cover in cling wrap or airtight cover and place into fridge overnight for at least 24 hours

## Cooking Method

### Primary Smoke (3 Hours)

  1. Remove Ribs from the fridge 1 hour before cooking to allow ribs to get to room temperature
  1. Set-up the BBQ-Smoker / Smoker (For Weber Kettle, I used the snake method with woodchips for the first 2 hours of smoke)
  1. Start the Smoker, pre-heat to 107C (225F)
  1. Place the Ribs, Meat Side Up onto cooking surface avoiding direct heat sources below the meat where possible. Use a Rib Rack if possible to avoid overlapping meat.
  1. Cover and allow Ribs to Smoke for 3 Hours at 107C (225F)
  
## Smoke & Steam (2 Hours)
This step is to re-introduce moisture to the ribs and re-hydrate them.

  1. Open Smoker and wrap ribs into Aluminium Foil, sprinkling sugar onto Meat Side and slightly expose the ends
  1. Using syringe, Inject Beef Stock (Or optionally, Bourbon) into foil rib packets
  1. Place back into Smoker, meat side up and allow Ribs to continue to cook for another 2 hours at 107C (225)
  
## Glaze and Final Cook (1 Hour)

  1. Pre-Heat Convection Oven to 180C (355F)
  1. Remove ribs from Smoker
  1. Remove the foil covers / packets and place Ribs into Shallow Oven Tray
  1. Using basting brush, brush the Ribs on both sides with a `Baste Sauce` and then place into Convection Oven at 180C (355F)
  1. Baste Meat Side every 10-15 minutes using `Baste Sauce`, glaze should be thick and caramelise but not burnt
  1. Remove Ribs after 45-60 minutes after 3 layers of baste have been applied
  1. Allow Ribs to cool for 5 minutes
  1. Baste light using `Primary Glaze`
  
## Serving Instructions

  * You may choose to pre-cut the ribs for convienence
  * Apply the Primary Baste/Glaze lightly, also provide guests the primary glaze/sauce if they would like additional sauce

## Storage

  * Store in air-tight container for up to 5 days
